[Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySRMDsJoIzM&ab_channel=TricksyPets) are cute bears, that everyone loves. Pandas is **also** the most widely used library for data science in Python. I can't introduce you to **all** of pandas, but I can get you to think about what pandas does from a computer science perspective.\n","\n","If you've ever worked with the language R, then you already know about the dataframe.

Look back at Assignment 0, where I use Pandas at the bottom to load a data set. \n","\n","Because we're computer scientists, it also helps to think of dataframes in terms of other data structures.\n","\n","Each **column** in a pandas dataframe is a Series. And a Series is effectively a cross between a dictionary, and an n-dimensional array. Hey! That's why they had us do dictionaries and arrays.\n","\n","A dataframe is just a collection of series. \n","\n","There's an introduction to Pandas [you can read](https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/python-pandas-tutorial-complete-introduction-for-beginners/). There's more here than you need for this assignment, but I absolutely recommend getting familiar with pandas.\n","\n","Below I load the wine data I used in Assignment 0 using the csv at my github account using pandas, exactly as I did in Assignment 0. I set the attributes - the column headings - as I read in the data. For now, they aren't very meaningful. \n","\n","I then show the head - the first 5 rows of the data.\n","\n","Pandas is an incredibly powerful library, but for now, see if you can:\n","\n","(a) Print the number of rows and columns in the wine data (HINT: Shape can help you here)\n","\n","(b) Print **just** the values from the att3 column. (HINT: Datframes behave like dictionaries in many ways)\n","\n","(c) Print the mean values for each column (and only the mean values) (HINT: Dataframes have methods that work over them)\n","\n","(d) Tell me if there are any **missing** values in this data. Missing values are represented by the special value NaN (which comes from numpy, Not a Number). (HINT: Some methods can be combined, such as summing all the NaN values, to get a count on a column by column basis)\n","\n","(e) We can use pandas to prepare data for machine learning. Just as with 4(d) above, we want to create **two** variables. **One** will be all the features **except** the class. The other will contain **just** the class values.\n","\n","To do this with pandas is easy. \n","\n","There is a method called drop, which allows you to drop a column. Let's say that att8 is the column we will try to predict.\n","\n","So, our input features will be everything except the column att8.
